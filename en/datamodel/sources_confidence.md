# Sources and Confidence

Every piece of data in Security Force Monitor has at least one source. Confidence scores are given to every piece of data from the Monitor's research with the exception of data related to alleged `incidents.`This is because event data is a repetition of allegations made by other organizations without any judgement as to the validity of those allegations by the Monitor.

## Sources

### Citation format {#source_citation_format}

Every data point in Security Force Monitor must have one or more sources associated with it. A source should be recorded in this format:

> Title of article or website page. Name of publishing organization \(country of organization\). Date. url. Internet Archive link: url

For example:

> Army parades oil bunkers in Kaduna. Premium Times \(Nigeria\). 8 May 2013. [http://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/nwest/133295-army-parades-oil-bunkers-in-kaduna.html](http://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/nwest/133295-army-parades-oil-bunkers-in-kaduna.html)  
> Internet Archive link: [https://web.archive.org/web/20140912060820/https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/nwest/133295-army-parades-oil-bunkers-in-kaduna.html\#sthash.Fc0DTTxe.dpbs](https://web.archive.org/web/20140912060820/https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/nwest/133295-army-parades-oil-bunkers-in-kaduna.html#sthash.Fc0DTTxe.dpbs)

### Country information {#source_country_information}

We include the country information because there could be a publication with the same name based in another country - for example there is [a publication based in Nigeria named The Guardian](https://guardian.ng/) as well as [a publication based in the United Kingdom named The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/uk).

### Date {#source_date}

When recording the date of a source for use in its citation,  we always use the format `DAY MONTH YEAR (DD MMMM YYYY)`

> 20 January 2012  
> 7 July 2016  
> 9 November 1999

## Confidence {#source_confidence}

Each data point \(except those tied to alleged `events`\) has a confidence score attached to it. The confidence scores only relate to the specific data point to which they are attached.

For instance, if a wide variety of sources agree that the `1 Division` is the name of an `organization` a confidence score of `High` would be assigned to this data point. However, if there is only one source for `One Division` as an alias, a confidence score of `Low` would be merited.

Confidence scores are determined first by what is agreed about the overall structure and nature of the security forces by reputable sources \(government, major reports/books and other sources of high quality information\). For example, if we know a police force is divided into Police Divisions and Police Stations and come across a source that references a Police Division, we would accept that source with `Low`  confidence as this agrees with what is generally known about the structure of the police. Conversely, if we came across a source that referenced a "Police Command Zone" we would want to do more research first before including it, as this does not fit into what is generally known about the structure of the police.

The confidence scores assigned to each data point are also influenced by the number of sources that agree on that data point and the time frame of those sources. For example, if fifty sources agree that in 2012 the `1 Battalion` was based in the New York City, we would have High confidence that `1 Battalion` was based in New York City in 2012. However, if we had one additional source that said the `1 Battalion` was based in New York in 1961, the Monitor would adjust its claim to say  the `1 Battalion` was based in New York City from at least 1961 to at least 2012. The confidence score would be downgraded to `Low`, since only one source places the `1 Battalion` in New York City in 1961 and the Battalion could have left anytime between 1962 and 2011.

All data points begin with a confidence score of `Low` until a confluence of sources merit the designation of `Medium`. The gap between upgrading the confidence score of a data point from `Low` to `Medium` is smaller than  when moving from `Medium to High`.
