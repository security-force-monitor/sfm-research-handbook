# Frequently Asked Questions about WhoWasInCommand


## How do I find what I'm looking for?

 * Type in some of terms that best describe the thing you're looking for
 * When you have some search results, use the filters to refine them
 * Use our "Countries" page as a jump-off point. It has direct links to all the units, person and incidents for a partiucular country, along with some "collections" we have added.

## How can I see all the units for a particular country?

The quickest way to do this is:

 * Select "Units" from the navigation bar at the top of WhoWasInCommand, which will list every unit in the database
 * Then, on this search results page open "General Filters", choose "Country" and select from that list
 * The results will then be filtered for that country.

## How do I get all the sources used in a record?

To get all the sources, hit "Download as CSV" on any record. This will start a download of an archive (`.zip` file) that will contain a number of Comma Separated Values (`.csv`) files with all the data used in that record, along with all the sources. These can be opened in any spreadsheet package.

## How do I see the sources used for a specific datapoint?

Let's say you are interested in the sources used to link a person to an organization:

Hover your mouse (or tap on it, if on a tablet or mobile) over any of the values and little coloured circle will appear:

![](/assets/wwic_sources_after_hover.png)

 Click it to see a little "pop-over" that lists all the sources for that datapoint:

![](/assets/wwic_sources_popover.png)

This pop-over shows you the number of sources for the datapoint. You can scroll up and down to see them, and click on the links to access the sources directly. It also shows you the confidence rating that we have given the specific datapoint. 

## What are those little numbered circles that keep appearing?

You mean these?

The little numbered circles indicate two things:
 * Click on it to show a list of the sources used to evidence that specific datapoint.
 * The colour indicates the level of confidence we have in the data: Red for "Low", yellow for "Medium" and green for "High". You can read an explanation of how we grade inforamation in this handbook's page on [Sources and Confidence](/datamodel/sourcesconfidence.md).

## Why do some dates have a dotted line beneath them and some don't?

![](/assets/wwic_start_date_dotted.png)

If there is a dotted line under a date, this means that we think this is an exact start date or exact end date. This means that a source has been very specific about the date when, for example, a unit was created or started operating in an area. 

If there is no dotted line under a date, this indicates that it is just the earlist reference we have for the creation of a unit, or the commencement of an operation.
