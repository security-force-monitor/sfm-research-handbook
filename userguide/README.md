# User Guide

This user guide provides a walkthrough to using Security Force Monitor's data visualization prototype.

This prototype visualizes the Security Force Monitor’s data about police, military and other security forces. Its goal is to make it easy to explore and understand the Monitor’s complex data on security forces. By making this information accessible the Monitor aims to assist journalists, human rights researchers, advocates, litigators and others identify specific perpetrators when human rights abuses occur.
