## About {#userguide_about}

This user guide provides a walk-through to using Security Force Monitor's data visualization prototype.

This prototype visualizes the Security Force Monitor’s data about police, military and other security forces. Its goal is to make it easy to explore and understand the Monitor’s complex data on security forces. For example, below is a chart view showing a command tree from the Mexican armed forces as an "organigram".

By making this information more accessible, the Monitor aims to assist journalists, human rights researchers, advocates, litigators and others identify specific perpetrators when human rights abuses occur. The view below shows the geographical area of responsibility of a military region in Mexico, along with bases, subordinate organizations, current and past commanding officers.

## Giving feedback {#userguide_feedback}

This a prototype, an experiment that we want to develop into a useful product. After using the prototype, we would be grateful if you got in touch and told us:

 * What do you like, and what don't you like?
 * Has something broken, or not worked in the way you would expect it to?
 * What else should it do?
 * Whether there are there features from other websites or data services that you think we should look at?

There are lots of ways to give feedback. Email us at [info@securityforcemonitor.org](mailto:info@securityforcemonitor.org?subject=Security Force Monitor Prototype Feedback), let us know over your preferred social media, or [open an issue on Github](https://github.com/security-force-monitor/sfm-ui).
