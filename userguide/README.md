## About {#userguide_about}

This user guide provides a walk-through to using Security Force Monitor's data visualization prototype.

This prototype visualizes the Security Force Monitor’s data about police, military and other security forces. Its goal is to make it easy to explore and understand the Monitor’s complex data on security forces. For example, below is a chart view showing a command tree from the Mexican armed forces as an "organigram".

By making this information more accessible, the Monitor aims to assist journalists, human rights researchers, advocates, litigators and others identify specific perpetrators when human rights abuses occur. The view below shows the geographical area of responsibility of a military region in Mexico, along with bases, subordinate organizations, current and past commanding officers.
