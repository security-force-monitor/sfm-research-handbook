## Using the Map's tools

### Legend

Clicking Legend displays three selections: _Events_, _Installations_ and _Area of Operations_. To learn more about what each of those terms mean, visit our **Glossary of Terms**.

Clicking any of the selections will make the Map only display data tied to that selection. For example, clicking on Events will remove all other data from the Map and only show data on Events. You can choose to only display one selection, only two, or all three.

* _Events_: Shows the location of an alleged of a human rights violation by security forces took place. Clicking on an Event node will display more information about the alleged abuse. For more detailed information on Events visit our **Methodology document**.
* _Installations_: Shows the locations of security forces. Clicking on an Installation node will display its dossier, which is further explained in the **Dossier section**.
* _Area of Operations_: Shows the geographic areas where the security forces operate. Clicking on a specific area of operations will display the organization's dossier, which is further explained in the **Dossier section**.

### Timeline

At the bottom of the screen you'll see the _Timeline_.

The timeline allows you to see what the data the Security Force Monitor has at different points in time. The goal is to make it easy for you to move through time and see how the map of the security forces area of operations and installations change. When you first come to a country the date selected is the current date. You can see the selected date in the small box in the left hand corner of your screen.

**You can change the selected date by clicking on the timeline.** To move further backwards in time click and drag the timeline. It will stop moving when you release your mouse. If you go too far back, you can always click and drag the timeline forward.

The _Installations_ and _Area of Operations_ will update every time you select a new date, displaying the data the Monitor has for that date. For Nigeria and Mexico the Monitor has fairly comprehensive data going back to roughly 2005 \(our earliest data point for any country is 1967!\)

##### Events in the Timeline

The Timeline also shows the chronology of the alleged human rights violations, which are also displayed on the Map.

Each event has a number according to its place in the timeline, starting from the oldest as number 1 and moving forward until the last event recorded in the Monitor's database. Place your arrow on any event on the timeline to get a glimpse of where the alleged event took place, its date and what type of violations are alleged to have occurred. Clicking on an event in the timeline will bring up the same information as clicking on an event on the Map. Again, for more detailed information on Events visit our **Methodology document**.

### Accessing the other tools: Chart, Dossier and Search

Now that you are more familiar with the Map you probably want to get even more information! The prototype has three other tools that are accessible from the Map screen. **The Chart,** **the Dossier** and **Search**.

Once you are on the Map you can select Search at any time. You can learn more about Search in the **Search section of this guide**.

Clicking on an Installation, Event or Area of Operations will bring up a mini-dossier on the right hand side of the screen. If you've clicked on a security force unit you'll have two options \(Events only have a mini-dossier\) --

1. _Click View Dossier_ - This will take you to the full dossier which you can learn more about in the **Dossier section of this guide**.
