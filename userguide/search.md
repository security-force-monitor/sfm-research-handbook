This feature let you chose your search method by “organization”, “persons” or “events”. For more information on those general concepts you can refer to our **Glossary of Terms**.

## Organizations Search

Searching for an organization will bring up a list which you can filter via the organization's classification or if there are any allegations against that organization. For example, searching for "Zona" in Mexico brings up 58 results which can be sorted to include all classifications \(the default\) or "Militar" \(Military\), "Ejercito" \(Army\), or Armada \(Navy\).

Clicking on any result will bring you to the Map with the organization's mini-dossier on the left, same as if you clicked on it directly from the Map. 

**Troubleshooting advice: The web application is a work in progress, sometimes you may need to click on the Map to get result to load.**

## Persons Search

Searching for a person will bring up a list of people, you can click on any of the results to go to that person's dossier.

## Events Search

Searching for an event will bring up a list of events, which you can filter via dates. Clicking on any of the results will bring you to that event's dossier.
