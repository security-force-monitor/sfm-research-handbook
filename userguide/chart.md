# Chart

Along with the Map, the prototype also gives you the option to visualize information about security forces in a Chart.

The Chart displays Command, Administrative and Informal hierarchies between units of the security forces. You can learn more about these categories by [reading our methodology](/methodology/methodology.md).

Once you've clicked "Chart" on the Map screen you'll be brought to the Chart. You will see the organization you were looking at in a chart connected to at least one other organization above or below it.

The Chart can be expanded either "up" or "down" the chain, depending on the organization you've selected. This guide will show you how to do both. You can always click and drag your cursor to navigate the Chart as well.

## Expanding the Chart

The initial Chart will only show the organization you were viewing and those organizations directly related to them. You can "expand" the Chart by clicking on any organization you see.

Let's start with an example organization - the 2 Battalion of the Nigerian Army. We've clicked on the 29 Battalion chart and are presented with this screen

You can click on the organization above it \(2 Amphibious Brigade in the example\) to expand the Chart "up" - doing so will cause more organizations to appear

You can keep clicking up the chain to expose the entire Chart.

The Chart also expands "down" to lower level units - as another example, we'll start with the Nigerian Army Headquarters ![Security Force Monitor - screenshot of Nigeria Army Headquarters - https://url-to-prototype/#country/ng/o/75280210-0828-4128-85e4-daeb98bdc6f3!date=2017-03-30&focus=chart&classifications=Army%29\](/assets/screenshot of Nigerian Army Headquarters.jpg)

This displays a Chart with "1 MORE" under 9 Brigade, clicking on "1 MORE" will expand the Chart downwards

## Timeline

At the bottom of the screen you'll see the _Timeline_.

![Security Force Monitor - screenshot of timelime on chart](/assets/screenshot of timeline_chart.jpg)

The timeline allows you to see what the data the Security Force Monitor has at different points in time. The goal is to make it easy for you to move through time and see how the Chart of the security forces change. You can see the selected date in the small box in the left hand corner of your screen.

![Security Force Monitor - screenshot of data selection on chart](/assets/screenshot of date selection _chart.jpg)

You can change the selected date by clicking on the timeline. To move further backwards in time click and drag the timeline. It will stop moving when you release your mouse. If you go too far back, you can always click and drag the timeline forward.

The Chart will update every time you select a new date, displaying the data the Monitor has for that date. It is possible to select a date where the Monitor does not have data - in that case you'll see a Chart with only the organization you are researching, and nothing else, try going forward in time to repopulate the Chart. For example, going back to 1998 with the 29 Battalion from the example above will get you this Chart

## Switching between Organizations and Commanders

The Chart makes it simple to highlight the organizations or their commanders - both buttons are right next to one another and you can click back and forth through them. When ever the Monitor does not have information about who was commanding a particular organization at a given date "Unknown Commander" is displayed.![Security Force Monitor - screenshot of organizations and commanders button - https://url-to-prototype/#country/ng/o/61437ac6-dfe0-4ff8-b729-16d2b4936cd2!date=2013-11-08&focus=chart&classifications=Army&perspective=organizations](/assets/screenshot of organizatiosn and commanders buttons.jpg)

## Getting Back to the Map or Dossier

You can always get back to the Map by clicking Map on the mini-dossier on the left hand of your screen![Security Force Monitor prototype - screenshot of map button from chart - https://url-to-prototype/#country/ng/o/61437ac6-dfe0-4ff8-b729-16d2b4936cd2!date=2007-06-06&focus=chart&classifications=Army](/assets/screenshot of Map button_Chart.jpg)

Also - you can always click View Dossier to get back to the Dossier![Security Force Monitor prototype - screenshot of view dossier button on chart - https://url-to-prototype/#country/ng/o/61437ac6-dfe0-4ff8-b729-16d2b4936cd2!date=2007-06-06&focus=chart&classifications=Army](/assets/screenshot of View Dossier button_Chart.jpg)
