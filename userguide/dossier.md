# Dossier

Every time you click on any Installation or Area of Operation on the map you have the option to click the View Dossier in the bottom right hand corner of the screen. The dossier is exists so that you can see the Monitor's data in a textual manner.

As a walkthrough to get to the dossier - from the Map we click on an Area of Operation which brings up a mini-version of the dossier on the right hand side of the screen. ![Security Force Monitor prototype - screenshot of dossier overlay on map](/userguide/assets/screenshot of map with clicked area of operation, mini dossier displayed_option 2.jpg)On the bottom right is View Dossier - clicking it brings us to the full dossier.

Both People and Organizations have Dossiers. Visit the [Persons](//datamodel/persons.md) and [Organizations](//datamodel/organizations.md) pages in this Research Handbook to detailed information on what you see in the Dossiers.
