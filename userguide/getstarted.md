# **Getting started - Country Selection**

After launching the prototype, the first screen you’ll come to is the country selection screen. The prototype currently has comprehensive data on Mexico and Nigeria, with some additional research tied to Nigerian units that performed peacekeeping duties in Sudan, Liberia, Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

You can always get back to the country selection screen, regardless of where you are in the prototype, by hitting the X next to the country name.

Once you’ve selected your country a country summary screen will come up on the right hand part of your screen, and a map of the country with the Monitor’s data will display on the rest of your screen.

The prototype has four main features to aid your research: **the map**, **the dossier**, **the chart**, and **the search**.

When you are ready to continue click on the screen to bring up the first tool, **the Map**.
