# What data does the Monitor collect? 

Security Force Monitor researches and creates data about three things (or _entities_) related to security forces around the world:

 * [Organizations](/datamodel/organizations.md) are official state  or state-sanctioned organizations responsible for the internal or external security for a country, including police, armed forces, navy, air force and other national security bodies. Organizations refer to any any part of the hierarchy of a security force, ranging from a national defence ministry, to a police unit based in a small town. Organizations can also be groupings of organizations that occur, such as operations or peacekeeping missions. The Monitor collects data about an organization's name, aliases, geographical areas of operation and relationships with other organizations.
 * [Persons](/datamodel/persons.md) are natural persons who are affiliated with, or hold positions of command over a specific organization at a particular point in time. The Monitor creates a dossier for each person, which includes their name, aliases, rank, title, role and the different organizations they have commanded.
 * [Events](/datamodel/events.md) are publicly-documented actions by security force personnel that constitute human rights violations. These include extrajudicial killings, rape, torture and other forms of violence.  For each Event, the Monitor includes a description, date(s), specific location(s), its perpetrators and the type of human rights violation.

Every piece of data collected by the Monitor is individually sourced. Data about Persons and Organizations are assigned a confidence rating, and a specific date or window of time for which sources confirm it to be accurate. The Research Handbook [section on sources and confidence](/sources_confidence.md) provides more guidance about this aspect. 

Detailed guidance about the fields used by the Monitor to record data about Organizations, Persons and Events is provided in the remainder of this document.
