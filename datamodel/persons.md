## ID {#person_id}

Use this field to put your name/initials and date on rows you enter data on. In the future this field will be used to create an unique identifier for each person in the Monitor’s database.

## Name {#person_name}

Full name of the individual - whenever possible the most complicated/complete name is used, even if it has the least number of citations.

Use the name with the most characters, for example `Magaji Musa Majia'a` instead of `Magaji Musa Majiaa`.

If an individual has held multiple positions within the security forces each position will require them to have a separate entry.

The full CMS will make this easy to do - while it's being built as a temporary fix place a \(1\) after their name so the system knows that John Smith is promoted from Major to General --- or that John Smith serves with the 21 Battalion until 2011 when he was transferred to the 22 Brigade.

## Aliases or alternative spellings {#person_other_names}

## Organization {#person_organization}

The organization that the individual is affiliated with. This organization must exist as an entry in the Monitor.

## Role {#person_role}

This column is to record the role the individual played in the organization that is usually not evident from their title or rank.

The main role we record - and that you will come across - is Commander.

There are a variety of other roles a person can have including Second in Command, Chief of Staff along with other less common entries.

As a special note, heads of academic or other security force institutions will sometimes be referred to as the Commandant. They should be put in the Title column and they should be recorded as Commander.

If someone is referred to as “the head” of an unit or it’s “chief” or some other variation indicating that they are in charge - they should be regarded as the Commander.  
If someone is referred to as “Spokesperson” and the source does not state that this person is a “Police Public Relations Officer” then the Role of that person is “Spokesperson”.

_Vice versa_, if in Nigeria for example, someone is listed as Police Public Relations Officer their role is also Police Public Relations Officer.

## Title \(official title\) {#person_title}

This column is to record titles that individuals have that are separate from their rank or role.

> For example commanders of army divisions in Nigeria, who usually hold the rank of Major General also hold the title of General Officer Commanding.

## Rank {#person_rank}

This column record the rank of the individual, as a style issue the Monitor removes dashes in ranks e.g. record an individual as Brigadier General rather than Brigadier-General.

## First citation {#person_date_first_cited}

## Start date? \(Y/N\) {#person_date_first_cited_is_start}

## Last citation {#person_date_last_cited}

## End date? \(Y/N\) {#person_date_last_cited_is_end}

## Notes {#person_notes}

Include any further information about this person that is relevant and interesting to the Monitor, but is not appropriate for other fields.
