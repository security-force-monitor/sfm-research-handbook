## ID {#person_id}

Use this field to put your name/initials and date on rows you enter data on. In the future this field will be used to create an unique identifier for each person in the Monitor’s database.

## Name {#person_name}

Full name of the individual - whenever possible the most complicated/complete name is used, even if it has the least number of citations.

Use the name with the most characters, for example `Magaji Musa Majia'a` instead of `Magaji Musa Majiaa`.

If an individual has held multiple positions within the security forces each position will require them to have a separate entry.

## Aliases or alternative spellings {#person_other_names}

## Organization {#person_organization}

The organization that the individual is affiliated with. This organization must exist as an entry in the Monitor.

## Role {#person_role}

This field is to record the role the individual played in the organization that is usually not evident from their title or rank.

The main role we record - and that you will come across - is Commander.

There are a variety of other roles a person can have including Second in Command, Chief of Staff along with other less common entries.

As a special note, heads of academic or other security force institutions will sometimes be referred to as the Commandant. They should be put in the Title column and they should be recorded as Commander.

If someone is referred to as “the head” of an unit or it’s “chief” or some other variation indicating that they are in charge - they should be regarded as the Commander.

## Title \(official title\) {#person_title}

This column is to record titles that individuals have that are separate from their rank or role.

> For example commanders of army divisions in Nigeria, who usually hold the rank of Major General also hold the title of General Officer Commanding.

## Rank {#person_rank}

This column record the rank of the individual, as a style issue the Monitor removes dashes in ranks e.g. record an individual as Brigadier General rather than Brigadier-General.

## First citation {#person_date_first_cited}

This field is for the earliest source the Monitor has showing an affiliation between this person and the organization. If the person's role, title or rank changes a new entry will need to created to document that change and a new first or last citation created to mark the change.

Role, Titles and Ranks are assumed until a source indicates a change.

> For example - If a source indicates that Major General Jack Johnson is the commander of 1 Division as of 2007-08-20 all of the revelevant fields would be entered based on that source. If another source states that Jack Johnson retired from the 1 Division on 2008-01-10 the last citation for Jack Johnson's affiliation would be 2008-01-10, however, this would also assume that Jack Johnson continued to have the Role of Commander and the Rank of Major General from 2007-08-20 until 2008-01-10

## Start date? \(Y/N\) {#person_date_first_cited_is_start}

If the date of first citation is start of this person's affiliation with the organization or the start date of their Role, Title or Rank put Y here. Otherwise, mark N.

## Last citation {#person_date_last_cited}

##  {#person_date_last_cited_is_end}

## End date? \(Y/N\) {#person_date_last_cited_is_end}

##  {#person_notes}

## Notes {#person_notes}
