# Research Handbook for Security Force Monitor

## About this Research Handbook

This Research Handbook contains information about the data and tools used by Security Force Monitor. Currently, it has two main sections:

* [Data Model](/datamodel/README.md): this section describes the way that Security Force Monitor structures the data it collects, outlines the main entities in use \(`persons`,`organizations` and `events`\) and details how each field is used. 
* [Prototype User Guide](/userguide/README.md): Security Force Monitor has developed a prototype web application to publish and visualize its complex data. This user guide provides basic information about the main features of the prototype, including its maps, charts, dossiers and search capabilities.

The Research Handbook is a living document, and is updated during the course of the work of Security Force Monitor. When reading it, we are sure you will find things that can be improved - please let us know what needs to be done, either by [emailing us](mailto:info@securityforcemonitor.org) or [filing a issue on Github](https://github.com/security-force-monitor/sfm-research-handbook/issues).

## About Security Force Monitor

While considerable technological and methodological advances have improved the documentation of human rights violations, a lack of clearly presented and precise information about police, militaries, and other security forces in countries of human rights concern continues to undermine these efforts.

There is a great deal of publicly available data on security forces, but it is unstructured and scattered amongst a wide variety of sources, making it prohibitively costly for those engaged in public interest work to understand the security forces of a particular country. The Security Force Monitor – a project of the [Columbia Law School Human Rights Institute](http://web.law.columbia.edu/human-rights-institute) – aims to solve this problem by structuring public data on security forces to empower and inform journalism, human rights reporting and other public interest work.

The Monitor compiles data from government sources, local and international news media, civil society reporting and other sources, assign a confidence level, and provide. This data will be published online using open source technologies and data visualization techniques. Researchers, journalists and other users will be able to explore the data in lots of different ways:

* Charts documenting the organizational and command hierarchies of police, military and security forces
* Maps of the location and jurisdiction of security forces
* Dossiers on commanders and units
* Maps and dossiers of documented human rights abuses committed by security forces as reported by civil society organizations, the United Nations and other sources
